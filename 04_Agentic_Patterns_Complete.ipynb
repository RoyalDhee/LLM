      "\n",
      "⚙️ Executing: 1. **Define the ReAct Pattern**: Start by looking up the basic definition of the ReAct pattern in the context of programming or software development. Identify its purpose and key components.\n",
      "Step 1 result: The ReAct pattern, short for \"React and Act,\" is a design pattern commonly used in programming, particularly in the context of event-driven systems and user interface development. It is often associated with frameworks like React, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Purpose:\n",
      "The primary purpose of the ReAct pattern is to manage the flow of data and events in a way that allows for responsive and interactive applications. It emphasizes the separation of concerns, making it easier to manage state and side effects in applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Components:\n",
      "1. **React**: This component is responsible for responding to changes in state or props. In a React application, this typically involves rendering UI components based on the current state of the application.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Act**: This component involves taking action based on the changes detected. This could include updating the state, making API calls, or triggering side effects. The \"Act\" phase is where the application responds to user interactions or other events.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **State Management**: The ReAct pattern often involves a state management solution (like Redux, Context API, or MobX) to handle the application's state in a predictable manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Event Handling**: The pattern includes mechanisms for handling events, such as user inputs, API responses, or other asynchronous actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Side Effects**: Managing side effects (like data fetching or subscriptions) is a crucial part of the ReAct pattern. This is often handled using middleware or hooks (like `useEffect` in React).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Declarative UI**: The ReAct pattern promotes a declarative approach to building user interfaces, where the UI is a function of the application state, making it easier to reason about and maintain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the ReAct pattern is about creating responsive applications that effectively manage state and side effects, leading to a more organized and maintainable codebase.\n",

      "The ReAct pattern, which stands for \"Reactive Action,\" is a way of building software, especially for user interfaces, that allows applications to respond quickly to changes. Imagine you are using an app that updates in real-time, like a chat app or a live sports score tracker. The ReAct pattern helps developers create these kinds of applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the main ideas behind the ReAct pattern:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reacting to Changes**: The core idea is that the app can react to changes in data or user actions immediately. For example, if someone sends a message in a chat app, the app shows that message right away without needing to refresh the page.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Data Sources**: The app uses data sources that can change over time, like user inputs or information from the internet. These data sources are like streams of information that keep flowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Observers**: There are special parts of the app called observers that watch these data sources. When something changes, the observers notice it and can trigger actions, like updating the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Actions**: Actions are what the app does in response to changes. This could mean showing new information, changing the layout, or even making a call to a server to get more data.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **State Management**: The app keeps track of its current state, which is like a snapshot of what’s happening at any moment. This state is updated whenever an action occurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **User Interface**: The way the app looks is based on its current state. Instead of telling the app how to change the UI step by step, developers describe what the UI should look like based on the state.\n",

      "4. **Actions**: Actions represent the operations that the application performs in response to changes in data. This could involve displaying new information, altering the layout, or making API calls to retrieve additional data.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **State Management**: The application maintains a centralized state, which serves as a snapshot of its current status at any given moment. This state is updated whenever an action occurs, ensuring that the application reflects the latest information.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **User Interface**: The user interface (UI) is designed based on the current state of the application. Instead of providing step-by-step instructions on how to update the UI, developers describe what the UI should look like according to the state, allowing for a more declarative approach.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **ReAct Pattern**\n",
    "   - Reason → Act → Observe cycle\n",
    "   - Built manually and with helper\n",
    "   - Most common agent pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Plan-Execute Pattern**\n",
    "   - Plan upfront, execute sequentially\n",
    "   - Better for complex tasks\n",
    "   - More predictable than ReAct\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reflection Pattern**\n",
    "   - Generate → Critique → Refine\n",
    "   - Self-improving agents\n",
    "   - Higher quality outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Manual vs Helpers**\n",
    "   - Helpers great for simple ReAct\n",
    "   - Manual needed for custom patterns\n",
    "   - Choose based on requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No one-size-fits-all** - Choose pattern for your use case\n",
    "- **Start simple** - ReAct is often enough\n",
    "- **Iterate** - Begin with basic, add complexity as needed\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task:** Combine Plan-Execute and Reflection patterns to create a high-quality multi-step agent.\n",

    "**Concept:** Use Plan-Execute to break down complex tasks, then use Reflection on the final output to ensure quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "1. Create a hybrid state that includes:\n",
    "   - Plan-Execute state (input, plan, current_step, results)\n",
    "   - Reflection state (draft, critique, iterations)\n",
    "2. Flow: Planner → Executor (loop) → Generator (uses results) → Critic → Refiner (if needed) → Finalizer\n",
    "3. The Generator creates initial output from all executor results\n",
    "4. The Critic evaluates the complete output (not individual steps)\n",
    "5. Refine the final output based on critique (max 2 reflection iterations)\n",
    "6. Track both execution progress AND reflection quality\n",
